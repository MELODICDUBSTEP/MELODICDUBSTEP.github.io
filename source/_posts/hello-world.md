##### Welcome to my channel! I'm Wenliang Tu, an undergraduate student majoying in computer science in SJTU. Nice2CU!

## This is all about me

## School work

I start my journey on computer science from 2022 Fall in John Hopcropt class, SJTU.

After one-year hard work, I get a glimpse of all kinds of fields of computer science, such as machine learning, computing complexity, combinatorics.

I will keep on going and try to top the CS world!

# Personal interest

I'm always the curious and trying type. I learnt piano when I was young, and right now I'm interested in all kinds of music, especially a genra called melodic dubstep.

Hope to meet like-minded friends!
